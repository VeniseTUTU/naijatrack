<p>
A project by CAFSED in collaboration with all various stakeholders and governments in Africa.
</p>
<p>
Leveraging on data in measuring Africa's progress towards SDGs, in the spirit of competitive federalism.
</p>
<p>
      The aim of this project is to devise a cross-cutting tool with reliable research and access to actual data so as to measure the overall performance of African nations and the state governments towards domestication and achieving the SDGs. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Based on inputs, performance is computed and shown as the distance traversed towards SDG targets on various SDG parameters integrating economic, social and environmental dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
      The project also aims to stimulate performance by promoting healthy competition and emulation among African member states. It targets and impacts all strata of Governments. They are to identify priority areas in which they need to invest and improve by enabling them to measure incremental progress.
      </p>
      <p>
      As an independent organisation and in consultation with our stakeholder partners, we shall select attainable and relevant SDG Indicators on which performance is computed and ranked. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Ministries and Agencies of governments both at federal and state levels are to provide data in thier participation which then informs the report and ranking exercise. 
      </p>
     

</div>
<div className="datacollRight">

      <p>
      This project is concieved to shake up conventional perception about development, we intend to make policy makers have begin rethinking their programme strategies by the report and result of data inputs indicating how they are performing in activities that directly affects the people.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Monitoring system and the online Dashboard, in the public domain, is meant to be a powerful instrument for federal, state governments, academia, policy makers, and the African public at large, so as to assess the performance of their governments in various sectors of SDGs, advocate for policy direction, learn from the best practices of relatively better performing units, and also influence governments to allocate resources in Goal areas for sharper focus. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The project is innovative and transformative in that it fuses the indicators on outcomes and on-going programme performance with transparent real-time display of results, as well as infuses outcome-orientation in the planning and implementation process, builds in the social and environmental dimensions of performance, and overturns the business-as-usual approach. 
      </p>
      <p>
      CAFSED is passionate and vigourously measuring the implementation progress of SDGs by harnessing the power of data to accelerate achievement of the SDGs in Africa.

      According to most of the recent Voluntary National Review Report published by the several offices dedicated to SDGs in Africa, among the five most remarkable challenges that may impede the journey towards the SDGs includes:
      </p>
      <p>
      SDGs Data Availability and Accessibility: Most of the NVR Report concluded that whereas commendable progress has been made to ensure that data is available for planning the various SDGs intervention
s and their tracking, African nations as still faces the challenge of weak data production and management system across all tiers of government.
      </p>
      <p>
      Hence, it was reccomended in some of the NVR Report that technology-based, open and transparent progress tracking and report systems for nationally agreed targets against set benchmarks is critical for the success of the SDGs implementation.

      Crucial to achieving and ensuring more equitable development and environmental sustainability as well as the overall success of the Global goal in Nigeria, is a strong government systems and in particular strong statistical systems that can measure and incentivize progress across the goals. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The discussion of the post-2015 development agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has renewed interest in the quality and availability of statistics for management, program design, and monitoring performance. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Most of the necessary statistics are produced by national statistical systems in developing countries, in Nigeria, the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the likes are doing the best they can in this regard and this data is a crucial component for good governance, if earnessed and utilised.
      </p>
      <p>
      The SDG indicators require the use of modern, innovative technologies, including geospatial data, for comprehensive, disaggregated and frequent data collection, across all three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, environmental, and social).
      </p>
      <p>
      Development data comes in many shapes and sizes. In its narrowest sense it refers to the data used to monitor progress on the SDGs, through official SDG indicators.
      </p>

      <p>
      Most stakeholders are interested in having rapid and easy access to the most recent data available for a key indicator. They often know, or have heard, that data exist for a given indicator, but don’t have ready access to this data. Sometimes, the publication is missing or they don’t have time to track down various data sources and compare the results of these surveys. They don’t have access to government and donor databases. The data are in formats which are difficult to use in reports and presentations and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
      Hence, the overaching purpose of SDG NIGERIA INDEX (SDGNI) is to help stakeholder users to capture, manage, present, disseminate and have ready access to all relevant human development data from all the states in Nigeria on one common database platform, aided by graphical data analysis for easy understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
      The open data web-based solution promotes the exploration, analysis, and use of authoritative SDG data sources for evidence-based decision-making and advocacy in ensuring policy makers focus on improving lives, fighting inequality, and promoting environmental sustainability.

      It is also in an attempt to bridge the data gap that we have developed a robust strategy with our data-driven initiative to partner with State and Regional governments as the case may be, Federal Ministries and Agencies as well as active development organisations to work with us assidously, so that through our web-based platform, reliable real time progress on SDGs can be monitored by all.
